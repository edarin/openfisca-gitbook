# Basic Use

### Work with Jupyter Notebook

[Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) is a wonderful project and a useful way to use OpenFisca without installing it on your computer.

A notebook is basically a web interface running in your browser, in which you write code and it displays results.

### Use OpenFisca Jupyter Notebook

As a requirement you must have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.

- Go to https://jupyter.openfisca.fr/
- Login with your GitHub account
- You have now a personal space to store and run your notebooks

The performance of the server is quite low.

Warning! There is no guarantee with your data so please backup your notebooks.

### Openfisca Packages

The French Tax and Benefit System exists as an [OpenFisca Python package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/OpenFisca-France/4.1.0).
